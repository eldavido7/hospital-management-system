# Hospital Management System

This project is a comprehensive Hospital Management System designed to streamline hospital operations, enhance patient care, and improve overall efficiency. It covers various aspects of hospital management, from patient registration and appointment scheduling to billing, laboratory test management, pharmacy operations, injection administration, vaccination, and HMO claim processing.

## Features

* **Patient Management**:

  * Register new patients with detailed personal and medical information.
  * Search and view existing patient records.

* **Appointment Scheduling**:

  * Schedule and manage appointments for consultations, lab tests, vaccinations, and other procedures.
  * View and manage daily and upcoming appointments.
  * Check-in patients and manage doctor queues.
* **Billing and Payments**:

  * Role-based access for departments (e.g., doctor, nurse, pharmacist, records, admin).

## üß≠ **Typical Main Patient Flow (From Registration to Completion)**

This captures the general flow of a patient visit, including all possible branches (lab, injection room, pharmacy, vaccination):

### **1. Registration**

* Patient is either:

  * **New**: Registered with demographic and insurance details (HMO or Cash).
  * **Returning**: Searched and selected from the database.
* A **billing item** for a consultation is generated:

  * **Cash patients** are sent to **Cash Point**.
  * **HMO patients** go to **HMO Desk** for authorization, then sent to **Vitals**.

---

### **2. Cash Point**

* Receives pending consultation billing.
* Accepts payment (Cash/Card/Transfer/Balance).
* Upon successful payment, patient is sent to **Vitals**.

---

### **3. Vitals (Nursing Station)**

* Vitals such as temperature, blood pressure, and weight are recorded.
* Patient is placed in the **Doctor Queue**.
* For **Vaccination consultations**, the nurse may approve/reject based on eligibility before moving the patient to payment.

---

### **4. Doctor Consultation**

* Doctor views patient history and vitals.
* Diagnosis is recorded.
* Doctor may:

  * **Send patient to Lab** for tests.
  * **Prescribe drugs**, which go to **Pharmacy**.
  * **Request injections**, which Pharmacy handles and routes to **Injection Room**.
  * **Admission**, which admits the patient as an inpatient (setup, but not working with central store yet).
  * **Complete consultation** if no further action is needed.

---

### **5. Lab (if requested)**

* Lab test request is created and sent to **Cash Point** or **HMO Desk** for approval.
* Once paid:

  * Tests are conducted.
  * Results are recorded and submitted.
  * Patient is sent back to the doctor to continue consultation.

---

### **6. Pharmacy**

  * **Prescription** from doctor.
  * **Injection request** or **vaccination** orders.
* Generates itemized billing:

  * Medications
  * Consumables (e.g., syringes, IV sets)
* Sends to **Cash Point** for payment.
* After payment:

  * Oral meds are dispensed directly.
  * Injections/vaccines are routed to **Injection Room**.

---

### **7. Injection Room**

* Receives a list of paid, pending injection/vaccine administrations.
* Administers the injections and records the action.
* Patient is marked as completed for this step.

---

### **8. HMO Desk (for HMO patients)**

* After service (drugs, labs, injections):

  * HMO claim is reviewed.
  * Status (approved/rejected) is updated.
  * Notes and codes are added as needed.

---

### **9. Records/Reports (Back Office)**

* Analytics and reporting tools allow admins to:

  * Review revenue, patient counts, pending services.
