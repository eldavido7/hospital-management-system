// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading.tsx file contains code that uses variables named
// "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and" without declaring them.
// To fix this, I will declare these variables at the top of the file with a default value of null.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual implementation might require importing these variables
// or assigning them appropriate values based on the original code's logic.
